# Derived Specs

Specs in this folder are derived artifacts.

They MUST:
- trace requirements to Constitution IDs (INV-*, DM-*, AC-*, KC-*)
- avoid introducing new domain concepts without updating the domain model
- prefer executable truth (tests, replays, golden cases) over prose

If a spec repeats authoritative content from the Constitution/ADRs/policies, replace prose with links/IDs.
